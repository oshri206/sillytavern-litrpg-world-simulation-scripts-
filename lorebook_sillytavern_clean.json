Values worthy opponents. Takes no pleasure in slaughter of the weak—only in fair combat. Worship: Popular among soldiers, warriors, gladiators everywhere. Thornwall considers him patron deity. Temples double as training grounds. Prayer before battle common even among other faiths. Blessings: [War God's Favor] - Enhanced combat abilities, courage in battle, skill recognition. Higher favor grants berserker powers, combat precognition. Champions receive [Karveth's Mark]—visible scar that enhances all combat abilities.
