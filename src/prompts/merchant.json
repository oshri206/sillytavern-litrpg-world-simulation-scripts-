    "Three apples, two rumors, and a promise to return the basket.",
    "Fresh spice! It tickles the truth right out of stew.",
    "Careful, these boots are still suspicious of puddles.",
    "Buy a lantern and I'll throw in a polite insult for free.",
    "This cloak is stitched from heroic intentions. Lightly worn.",
    "Hammers half off because the anvil is sulking.",
    "A bargain? Sure. I just need a story with a good ending.",
    "Swords that sing! Sometimes they hum off-key.",
    "Take a charm, ward off bad luck, or at least confuse it.",
    "We accept coin, favors, and really dramatic sighs.",
    "The river paid me in pearls and I am passing the savings on to you.",
    "I traded a dragon a compliment for this fine kettle.",
    "My inventory changes with the wind. So do my prices.",
    "Hats! For heads, pigeons, and hard negotiations.",
    "Need rope? It's been trained not to untie itself.",
    "These gloves have never lost an argument.",
    "I sold a mirror a reflection once. It never forgave me.",
    "Fresh parchment, still smells like dramatic pauses.",
    "Potions? We have potions. Also vague promises in bottles.",
    "Buy two trinkets, get a third that's mildly haunted."
